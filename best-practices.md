# Best practices for SIGs

## Scheduling meetings
ONNX has a global community so SIG chairs should schedule meetings to accomodate different geographies. Unfortunately there isn't a single time that accommodates everyone in the world. Depending on the participants in the group, a specific time may be better for most people or meeting times may need to be alternated to give different geographies a chance to participate at reasonable times.

## Documents and artifacts
Files that are specific to the operation of the SIG (such as meeting notes, rules, etc) should be kept in the "sigs" repository in the directory for the SIG. Workings drafts can also be maintained here until they are ready to be submitted to the main repos for broader review.

## Meeting notes
Meeting notes must be kept for every meeting. Attendence should also be recorded as part of the notes. The file name should include the date to make it easy to find.

## Meeting recording
At the discretion of the SIG chairs, meetings can optionally be recorded and published to the ONNX YouTube channel. We are not requiring this at this time but may do so in the future.

## Publish agenda ahead of meeting
SIG chairs must publish the agenda at least 2 days ahead of a meeting. The agenda should be published as the file for the meeting notes for easy discoverability.

## Publish meeting notes soon after meeting
Notes should be published within a day of the meeting. Usually notes can be published the same day because the SIG chairs would be taking notes directly in the file that has the agenda.

## Slack Channel
SIG have slack channels as part of LF AI & Data.  SIG leaders and participants can use the slack channels to prepare for meetings, send reminders, help with above items, and more.
