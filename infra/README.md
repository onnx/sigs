# ONNX Architecture & Infra Special Interest Group (SIG)

This is the working repo for the architecture & infra special interest group (SIG), which is responsible for defining and maintaining the core ONNX format, the build and CI/CD systems for ONNX repositories, publishing release packages for ONNX, the onnx-docker repository, and creating tools to help integrate with and test against the ONNX standard. This SIG is also the defacto owner of files in the main ONNX repository unless explicitly owned by another SIG.
This repo contains all the artifacts, materials, meeting notes and proposals regarding ONNX infra evolution in ONNX standard. Feedbacks and contributions are welcome.
