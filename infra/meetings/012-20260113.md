## Agenda
1) Meeting setup: Move meeting time?
1) Roadmap:
   * How can we solicit feedback and insights into priorities and pain points of the community (on a short time scale)? I'd like to discuss different avenues available to us.
   * A non-exhaustive list of options to be discussed is soliciting feedback from SIGs or if we want to make a public call for feedback.
2) RFC template
   * Should we introduce/revive a templated RFC process for new operators and major features akin to Rust's RFCs or Python's PEPs?
3) Release 1.20: Release Process Review, Lessons Learned
