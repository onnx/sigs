## Agenda
1) Review OpenSSF Best Practising
2) Roadmap:
   * How can we solicit feedback and insights into priorities and pain points of the community (on a short time scale)? I'd like to discuss different avenues available to us.
   * A non-exhaustive list of options to be discussed is soliciting feedback from SIGs or if we want to make a public call for feedback.
3) RFC template
   * Should we introduce/revive a templated RFC process for new operators and major features akin to Rust's RFCs or Python's PEPs?
4) Release 1.21: Release Process (not covered that meeting)
5) 2) ONNX Testing Repo (not covered that meeting)

## Open issues from recent meetings

* 2026.01.13: Christian: Check with Conda-forge experts and investigate if release candidates can trigger automatic PRs on Condoforge, and consider automating this process.
* 2026.01.13: Justin: Fill in the new RFC template with details about the "equivalence of graphs" proposal once Christian provides the template.
* 2026.01.13: Christian: Coordinate with Justin (and optionally Javier) to schedule a broader discussion about the "equivalence of graphs" RFC after the template is filled out.
* 2026.01.27: Andreas: Prepare a list of specific security questions/issues and examples from other projects for the team to review regarding OpenSSF best practices and security documentation.
* 2026.01.27: Andreas: Update documentation regarding known vulnerabilities, especially the two path traversal issues, and send relevant links to the team.
* 2026.01.27: Christian/Andreas/Team: Review the codebase (especially check_model and load_model functions) to assess handling of untrusted input and determine if security design principles are met; report findings.
* 2026.01.27: Christian: Circulate the draft roadmap survey in relevant Slack channels and other SIGs for trial feedback.
* 2026.01.27: All: Fill out the roadmap survey as a trial run and provide feedback to Christian, especially regarding missing questions or improvements.
* 2026.01.27: Christian: After receiving initial feedback, circulate the finalized survey to the wider community via Slack, mailing lists, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other relevant channels.
* 2026.01.27: Christian: Present the new roadmap process/survey to the steering committee at the next meeting.
* 2026.01.27: Andreas: Add relevant proposals from the wiki to the main RFC/proposals list and remove redundant or outdated entries.
* 2026.01.27: Christian: Review which version of proposals (wiki vs. repo) is most up-to-date and consolidate into one canonical entry point, deleting redundant sections.
* 2026.01.27: Christian: Update the RFC template/process documentation to clarify that RFCs should go through the relevant SIG for approval, and that minor edits/updates to RFCs are acceptable via PR process.

### www.bestpractices.dev ###

* Andreas addressed:
  * Secure release: "The project MUST cryptographically sign releases of the project results intended for widespread use, and there MUST be a documented process explaining to users how they can obtain the public signing keys and verify the signature(s). The private key for these signature(s) MUST NOT be on site(s) used to directly distribute the software to the public. If releases are not intended for widespread use, select "not applicable" (N/A)
  * Other security issues: Hardening mechanisms SHOULD be used in the software produced by the project so that software defects are less likely to result in security vulnerabilities. [hardening]
Hardening mechanisms may include HTTP headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), compiler flags to mitigate attacks (such as -fstack-protector), or compiler flags to eliminate undefined behavior. For our purposes least privilege is not considered a hardening mechanism (least privilege is important, but separate). 

* To get the Silver Badge, we need a few more points. The Silver Badge would be needed as a Graduated Project from LF AI&Data. But it's definitely necessary if you want to become a Foundation Level Project of the PyTorch Foundation. 
* Currently, the publicly visible status is as follows: https://www.bestpractices.dev/de/projects/3313/passing

* The team discussed the OpenSSF best practices requirements for the ONNX project, focusing on security documentation and implementation. Andreas highlighted that they would need to update the formular regarding unfixed security (or fix the path transversal) vulnerabilities
* Christian stated that ONNX's C/C++ codebase and complex implementation present security concerns. The team agreed to document what users can expect in terms of security from the software, with Andreas planning to prepare a list of specific security questions based on other projects. They also discussed the project's handling of dependencies and static linking, with Ganesan mentioning precautions taken for file traversal in loading external tensor data.

* The team discussed the status of their codebase regarding security vulnerabilities and compliance with security design principles. Christian and Ganesan expressed uncertainty about whether the codebase meets security requirements, citing its complexity and the difficulty of making definitive statements without expert analysis. They agreed to mark the security status as "question mark" for now, acknowledging that thorough validations of user-provided data and adherence to certain design principles exist but may not fully address all potential vulnerabilities. 
* The team discussed security concerns around untrusted input handling in ONNX, particularly focusing on path traversal vulnerabilities and null pointer dereferencing issues. Christian and Ganesan highlighted that while the library performs checks at high-level APIs, lower-level APIs may assume trusted input, potentially leaving room for security vulnerabilities. Justin mentioned that path traversal issues were a known concern, and the team agreed to conduct a self-survey to identify additional potential security risks.


### protobuf Versioning ###

* The team discussed code quality and versioning issues, particularly regarding protobuf. They identified that while they are using a newer version (3.31) in development, their release build is using an older version (4.25). Christian noted that the current version is 33.4. The team agreed to review their warning settings and sanity checking tools, with Ganesan suggesting they could compare their tools to those used by other software projects. They decided to create a pull request to document their findings and continue discussions in future meetings about PyTorch Foundation matters.

### Community Survey Planning Discussion ###

The team discussed a new survey draft for gathering community feedback on priorities and pain points, which will inform future planning and roadmap discussions. Christian emphasized the need to distinguish this lightweight survey process from the previous roadmap format, suggesting alternative terms like "2026 Planning" to avoid confusion. The group agreed to test the survey internally via Slack before wider dissemination through multiple channels including Twitter, LinkedIn, and Reddit, with Andreas suggesting they could also highlight the availability of special interest groups for more detailed discussions.

### RFC Process and Template Review ###

Christian and Andreas discussed posting a roadmap and presenting it to the steering committee. They also reviewed an RFC template, deciding not to migrate old proposals to the new template. Christian explained that minor edits to accepted RFCs are acceptable, but major changes should go through a regular PR process. Ganesan raised questions about the process for approving RFCs, and Christian clarified that they should still go through the relevant SIG. They agreed that the RFC template is not meant to be religiously followed, but rather to help centralize discussions and improve transparency.
