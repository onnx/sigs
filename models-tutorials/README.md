# ONNX Model Zoo & Tutorials Special Interest Group (SIG)

This is the working repo for the ONNX model zoo and tutorials special interest group (SIG). This repo contains all the artifacts, materials, meeting notes and proposals regarding pretrained models, tutorials, and outreach materials for ONNX. 

The Model Zoo and Tutorials SIG is responsible for the comprehensive collection of state of the art ONNX models from a variety of sources and making it easy for users to get started with ONNX and the ecosystem around it. Concretely, this SIG has ownership over the [onnx/tutorials](https://github.com/onnx/tutorials) and [onnx/models](https://github.com/onnx/models) repositories, as well as tutorials located in the [onnx/onnx-docker](https://github.com/onnx/onnx-docker) repository, instructive blog posts and conference participation. 

Feedback and contributions are welcome.
