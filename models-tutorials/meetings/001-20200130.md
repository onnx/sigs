## Agenda
* Introductions
* Formalize scope of this SIG
* Discuss Mission Statement and Core Priorities. Refine based on feedback.
* Proposed Action Items:
  * Move all models in model zoo to Git LFS, standardize READMEs
    * Include guidelines on git commands that are relevant to LFS.
  * Develop a CI for Model Zoo
    * Base requirement: run ONNX checker on each model.
  * Establish guidelines for new models and tutorials to be added to the ONNX ecosystem

## Attendees 
* Vinitra Swamy (Microsoft)
* Svetlana Levitan (IBM)
* Lara Haidar (Microsoft)
* Negin Raoof (Microsoft)
* Ksenija Stanojevic (Microsoft)
* Rajeev Rao (nVidia)
* Faith Xu (Microsoft)

## Notes
* Discussion on action items / mission statement
  * We need a clear policy for adding and deprecating models
  * This SIG should take responsibility for maintaining model zoo versions
    * Perhaps we can automate this with the version converters
    * This removes the burden from the contributor to deal with the maintanence costs
  * Can we measure Model Zoo analytics? Which models are downloaded often? Is the model zoo useful?
  * Outreach
    * Listing all the products that support ONNX / maintaining that list on the ONNX Website
    * Listing ONNX related events and community workshops on the ONNX website (to be added and maintained by community members)
