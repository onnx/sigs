## Notes
* SIG Name Change
  * After presenting the new "Outreach" name for the SIG to the Steering committee, the consensus was that the name does not entirely reflect
the larger technical charter of this SIG.
  * "Model Zoo, Tutorials, and Conferences" is a bit long as well.
  * Let Vinitra know if you have any ideas!
