      * ~Include guidelines on git commands that are relevant to LFS.~
  * Develop a CI for Model Zoo.
      * Base requirement: run ONNX checker on each model.
  * ~Draft of guidelines for new models to be added to the ONNX ecosystem.~
  * ~Create list ofÂ known upcoming ONNX community events~
  * Investigate Model Zoo analytics on Github
  * ~Investigate new models to be added to the model zoo (NLP)~

## Attendees 
* Vinitra Swamy (Microsoft)
* Svetlana Levitan (IBM)
* Ksenija Stanojevic (Microsoft)
* Rajeev Rao (nVidia)
* Faith Xu (Microsoft)
* Prasanth Pulavarthi (Microsoft)
* Kevin Chen

## Notes
* SIG Name Change
  * After presenting the new "Outreach" name for the SIG to the Steering committee, the consensus was that the name does not entirely reflect
the larger technical charter of this SIG.
  * "Model Zoo, Tutorials, and Conferences" is a bit long as well.
  * Let Vinitra know if you have any ideas!

  - Ksenija
  - Rajeev
  - Instructions:
    - [Example PR for Git LFS Migration (Emotion FER+)](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/278)
    - Navigate to github page and download model from links on github page
    - Create a model folder (for the .onnx files, the .tar.gz files, and the md5 file)
      - Consolidate the MD5 files (if there are multiple), into one file
        - 5138c2e24f45d391be3e9e53f5732e02 bertsquad-8.onnx  
          dc59794145b4a37995a2667370dc3d6f bertsquad-10.onnx
      - If there are only .tar.gz files, and not .onnx files, make sure to extract .onnx files from the tar.gz and update the README
      - Naming conventions can be found in the sample PR (i.e. bert-squad-8.onnx and bert-squad-8.tar.gz)
    - If there are other relevant files already in the folder, create a "dependencies" folder and move those scripts there -- see BERT for example.
    - Simply git commit / push with the files in the correct locations
    - Remember to use absolute file links instead of relative file links in the README
- XXX - Investigate Model Zoo analytics on Github
- XXX - Proposal to deal with versioning of Model Zoo models
- XXX - Guidelines for addition of tutorials
- Vinitra - Formalize CI Plan for Model Zoo
