## Agenda / Notes
* [Git LFS](https://github.com/onnx/models/issues/271) - all models have been migrated to Git LFS successfully! 
  * This enables a one line download of all models
  * This also enables the zoo to maintain the models itself without relying on different user repositories
  * Discussion: bandwidth / estimating usage (Prasanth)
* [Model Zoo CI] PR in progress
  * [PR #307](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/307)
  * Feedback will be helpful!
  * Azure Pipelines, but considering moving to Github actions because of Git LFS bandwidth usage
  * Enabling caching to make sure only PR relevant models are pulled each time
* Upcoming model additions
  * EfficientNet-Lite (in progress)
    * Tutorial from Guenther from [Tensorflow-ONNX](https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx/blob/master/tutorials/efficientnet-lite.ipynb)
  * New models being added by Kundana, Shirley, and Jennifer
    * DeepVoice
    * VisualQuestionAnswering Model
    * YoloV4
    * EfficientNet-Det / EfficientNet-Edge / SSD MobileNet v2 based on tf2onnx tutorials
* Community events
  * WIDS 2020 Workshop went well! Recordings can be found at [SAP WIDS 2020 website](https://events.sap.com/us/wids-2020-sv/en/home)
* Deprecate Checksums 
  * [PR #290](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/290) addresses some checksum removal and the rest have been removed through the Git LFS migration process.
* User Traffic Analysis / Analytics (RepoTraffic, RepoAnalytics)
  * Tracked in issue [#51](https://github.com/onnx/sigs/issues/51)
