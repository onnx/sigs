## Agenda / Notes
* [Git LFS](https://github.com/onnx/models/issues/271) - all models have been migrated to Git LFS successfully! 
  * This enables a one line download of all models
  * This also enables the zoo to maintain the models itself without relying on different user repositories
  * Discussion: bandwidth / estimating usage (Prasanth)
    * similar cost for Azure/AWS hosting. After Model Zoo CI work settles down, bandwidth will hopefully return to normal
    * include model zoo best-practice usage suggestions to not overload bandwidth
* [Model Zoo CI](https://github.com/onnx/sigs/issues/53) PR in progress
  * [PR #307](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/307)
  * Feedback will be helpful!
  * Azure Pipelines, but considering moving to Github actions because of Git LFS bandwidth usage
  * Enabling caching to make sure only PR relevant models are pulled each time
* [Upcoming model additions](https://github.com/onnx/sigs/blob/master/models-tutorials/docs/ProposedModels.md)
  * EfficientNet-Lite (in progress)
    * Tutorial from Guenther from [Tensorflow-ONNX](https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx/blob/master/tutorials/efficientnet-lite.ipynb)
  * New models being added by Kundana, Shirley, and Jennifer
    * DeepVoice
    * VisualQuestionAnswering Model
    * YoloV4
    * EfficientNet-Det / EfficientNet-Edge / SSD MobileNet v2 based on tf2onnx tutorials
* [Community events](https://github.com/onnx/sigs/blob/master/models-tutorials/docs/CommunityEvents.md)
  * WIDS 2020 Workshop went well! Recordings can be found at [SAP WIDS 2020 website](https://events.sap.com/us/wids-2020-sv/en/home)
* Deprecate Checksums 
  * [PR #290](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/290) addresses some checksum removal and the rest have been removed through the Git LFS migration process.
* User Traffic Analysis / Analytics (RepoTraffic, RepoAnalytics)
  * Tracked in issue [#51](https://github.com/onnx/sigs/issues/51)
* Progress on last month's action items:
  * ~Finish moving models in model zoo to Git LFS~
    * finished, tracked in #271
  * ~Make Progress on CI for Model Zoo~
    * https://github.com/onnx/sigs/issues/53
    * [PR #307](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/307)
    * Base requirement: run ONNX checker on each model.
  * ~Model Zoo analytics – how to ensure models are useful?~
    * https://repo-analytics.github.io/onnx/models
    * https://repo-analytics.github.io/onnx/tutorials
  * ~Guidelines for addition of tutorials~
    * ~merge Model Zoo addition guidelines~ - updated Pull Request Template
    * Plan in progress for issue templates (Ashwini)
  * Proposal to deal with versioning of Model Zoo models
     * https://github.com/onnx/sigs/issues/52
     * integration of version converters
  * ~New Models planning~

## Action Items
* Make progress on new models (2-3 PRs at least)
* Check in Model Zoo CI and resolve caching problems
* Estimate usage adequately and budget data packs / month for Git LFS
* Look into adding new ONNX Runtime training models into the model zoo (Svetlana)
* Review requirements for adding a new model (Ashwini)
 * Let's make sure it includes enough about the source model to re-export in a new opset

## Next Meeting
mid July
