## Agenda / Notes
* (Last meeting) [Git LFS](https://github.com/onnx/models/issues/271) - all models have been migrated to Git LFS successfully! 
  * This enables a one line download of all models
  * This also enables the zoo to maintain the models itself without relying on different user repositories
  * So far, this has been working well!
* [Model Zoo CI](https://github.com/onnx/sigs/issues/53) PR merged!
  * [PR #307](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/307)
  * Using Azure Pipelines to run ONNX Checker on only models that have been changed in the PR
  * Next iteration: check model inputs and outputs with ONNX Runtime
  * Weekly run / regression test for the models (build from source for ONNX)
  * version converter for models
* [New Models added to the Model Zoo](https://github.com/onnx/sigs/blob/master/models-tutorials/docs/ProposedModels.md)
  * EfficientNet-Lite [#324](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/324)
  * RoBERTa [#338](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/338)
  * SSD MobileNet v1 [#328](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/328)
  * YoloV4 [#322](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/322)
* Model Updates
  * VQA (tabled for now)
  * DeepVoice (tabled for now, pending PyTorch converter bug)
  * Fixes for SqueezeNet, ResNet, SuperResolution
  * Community contributions: new flavor of GPT-2 [#327](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/327), update to pre/post process of GoogleNet[#333](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/333), Transformer Language model (T5 [#357](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/357))
  * ML Perf model updates / inclusions
* [Model Zoo API](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/355) PR is out, feedback would be very helpful!
  * Objective: API for users to easily list and obtain model files
  * https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/355
* **Model Zoo SIG Intern Presentation** - Kundana, Shirley, Jennifer
* **Model Zoo Website Hackathon Project** - Jacky
  * github authentication
  * onnx.ai new tab for the model zoo UI
* [Community events](https://github.com/onnx/sigs/blob/master/models-tutorials/docs/CommunityEvents.md)
* User Traffic Analysis / Analytics (RepoTraffic, RepoAnalytics)
  * Tracked in issue [#51](https://github.com/onnx/sigs/issues/51)
* Progress on last month's action items:
  * ~Make progress on new models (2-3 PRs at least)~
    * checked in 4 new models and more to come
  * ~Check in Model Zoo CI and resolve caching problems~
    * Model Zoo CI is working for each new PR!
    * https://github.com/onnx/sigs/issues/53
    * [PR #307](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/307)
  * Estimate usage adequately and budget data packs / month for Git LFS
    * Looks like previous month with increased usage was an anomaly
  * Look into adding new ONNX Runtime training models into the model zoo (Svetlana)
  * Update Model Zoo Github best practices
    * Review requirements for adding a new model (Ashwini)
      * Let's make sure it includes enough about the source model to re-export in a new opset
    * ~Issue templates (bug reports, etc.)~
* Formalize new action items

## Attendees 
* Vinitra Swamy (Microsoft)
* Ashwini Khade (Microsoft)
