## Agenda / Notes
* Vinitra stepping down from SIG lead to start PhD @ EPFL, handing over SIG Lead position to Wenbing Li
    * We are looking for co-leads -- please reach out to Wenbing and the Steering Committee if interested!
* [New Models added to the Model Zoo](https://github.com/onnx/sigs/blob/master/models-tutorials/docs/ProposedModels.md)
* Model Updates
  * Fixes for SqueezeNet, ResNet, SuperResolution
  * Community contributions: new flavor of GPT-2 [#327](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/327), update to pre/post process of GoogleNet[#333](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/333), Transformer Language model (T5 [#357](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/357))
  * ML Perf model updates / inclusions
* [Model Zoo API](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/355) PR is out
  * Objective: API for users to easily list and obtain model files
  * https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/355
* [Model Zoo CI - using ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/376) - Jacky
* [Community events](https://github.com/onnx/sigs/blob/master/models-tutorials/docs/CommunityEvents.md)
* User Traffic Analysis / Analytics (RepoTraffic, RepoAnalytics)
  * Tracked in issue [#51](https://github.com/onnx/sigs/issues/51)
* Look into adding new ONNX Runtime training models into the model zoo (Svetlana)
* Update Model Zoo Github best practices
    * Review requirements for adding a new model (Ashwini)
      * Let's make sure it includes enough about the source model to re-export in a new opset
         * scenarios: mobile, quantization, etc.
      * We do need to do an accuracy test after re-exporting the models (Wenbing)
      * Infra for accuracy testing (investigation)
* Model preprocessing + postprocessing (Vinitra, Tom)
    * preprocessing layers within ONNX (necessity for string ops, etc) - discussed in ONNX Roadmap meetings
        * very difficult to standardize within the ONNX standard, but could be scoped for smaller use cases (Ashwini / Wenbing)
    * bar new models that use another framework in the preprocessing

## Attendees 
* Vinitra Swamy (EPFL)
* Wenbing Li (Microsoft)
* Ashwini Khade (Microsoft)
* Svetlana Levitan
* Jacky Chen (Microsoft)
* Natalie Kershaw (Microsoft)
* Tom Wildenhain (Microsoft)
* Jim Spohrer (LF AI)

## Recorded Meeting
Topic: ONNX Model Zoo SIG Meeting
Start Time : September 25, 2020 10:30 AM

## Action Items
- Schedule meeting to discuss version control for models (re: version converter, maintaining source framework models etc.)
- Determine integration plan / what features neet to be done for Jacky's Hackathon UI

## Next Meeting
mid October
