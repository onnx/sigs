## Notes
* We spend the entire meeting discussing the dynamic shape.
* Some of the discussion, where around:
    * Tensor properties for dynamic or static.
    * Define maximum size based on dimension.
    * Should this part of the standard?
    * Implementation details vs standard.
    * Pad or not padding
    * Who specify the value? And what is the end-to-end experience?
    * A mechanism to specify dynamic versus static.

## Action items
* Leonid Goldgeisser - to write a draft document for the dynamic shape and share it with the rest of the group.
