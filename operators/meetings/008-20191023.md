## Notes
* We discussed and agreed on the operator removal proposal.
* Most of the discussion boiled down, one how to make it easy for the user to know what to do.
    * Archive older operator.md for each release.
    * Add link to changelog in operator.md.
    * Investigate adding the list of removed operator to the main operator.md.
* Einsum
    * Add it as operator to ONNX.
    * Check if other operators can be replaced by a function.
    * Open question: should this be in core ONNX or different domain?
* Function: didn't have time to discuss it.

## Action items
* Emad Barsoum - submit the operator removal requirements to ONNX master.
* Michal Karzynski - investigate adding the list of removed operator to operator.md.
* Leonid Goldgeisser - to write a draft document for the dynamic shape and share it with the rest of the group.
