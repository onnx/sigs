## Notes
* Discussed optimizer and loss function for the training PR.
* Spend most of the time debating initializer versus mutable_initializer.
    * mutable_initializer need to be string corresponding to tensors in the initializer list that are mutable.
    * Concern about backward compatibility was raised.
* Remove PyTorch tests from ONNX repo, we should block ONNX PR because of a framework specific test.
* We got Alibaba presentation, but no one from Alibaba attended.

* Alibaba - sharing the code, any documentation and prepare a presentation for next meeting.
