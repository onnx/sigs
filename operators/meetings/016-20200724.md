## Agenda
* Adding new type to existing operator.

* Discussed: https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/2912
* Beam Search: extend loop.

## Notes
* We agreed to remove the restriction for bumping OPSet version when we add new type. 
    * Assuming no logic change and we just added a new type to the operator input or output, then there is no need to increase the OPSet version number for such operator.
* Discussed AddNewOpV3 doc again, will get feedbacks through PR.
* Based on last meeting the updated softmax is converted to a function (https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/2879), we discussed how can we test that. Conclusion, evaluate the test ONNX model in ONNX Runtime offline.
* We also discussed the following proposal https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/2912, which is about should we update test generator to be version aware. This require more discussion.
* We discussed also extending Loop construct for beam search by make it accept any loop carry type. We didn't come to any conclusion, we will continue the discussion in github or gitter.
