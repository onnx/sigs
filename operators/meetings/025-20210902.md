## Notes

### Infrastructure SIG updates

* [PR 3633] (https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/3663) has been merged. This PR introduces Python
APIs to download models from the model hub.

### Issue: Outputs of unknown rank in models

Michal had a question as to whether ONNX should permit models where the output tensors are
of unknown rank. The checker currently complains about such models. The use-case Michal described
is one where we extract a sub-graph of a larger model and turn it into a model. In some cases,
shape-inference may not be able to infer the rank of the output tensors in such cases.
An example is the `Reshape` operator, whose output tensor's rank is statically unknown if
the input that specifies the target shape is not a static constant. Ashwini pointed out
a couple of possible solutions: one is to run inference on the original model to infer
shapes before exporting the subgraph; a second option is to use the recently introduced
data-propagation, which improves the results of shape-inference in some common scenarios
involving `Reshape`.

There was no decision to change the ONNX spec, which currently requires output tensors to
have a statically known rank.

### Issue: Test-cases for non-deterministic operators

The recently introduced Bernoulli operator is a non-deterministic operator. Yet, this
operator has test-cases with expected outputs. Michal asked if we should remove these
testcases given that the operator is non-deterministic and may produce different
results in different implementations. This issue has been discussed in previous Operator
SIG meetings. The python code, however, has value as an illustrative example. 
We decided to extend the test-generation infrastructure so that such examples could
be annotated appropriately so that a corresponding test-case is *not* generated from
such examples by default (unless an explicit option is specified for the test-generator
to generate test-cases for these ops).

### [Issue 3637](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/3637): Overflow for 8-bit arithmetic ops

[Issue 3637](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/3637) asked for clarification in the spec
about what the output should be for arithmetic ops on 8-bit integers in case of overflow.
This issue has been previously discussed. We agreed to continue with the current position
that the results are undefined in these cases (at least until there is further clarity
in the community as to which semantics is most appropriate). It was clarified that the
current test-cases avoid overflow and, hence, these test-cases themselves are not a concern.

### [PR 3484](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/3484): Add `reduction` attribute to Scatter style ops

This PR is almost ready to be merged in, except for one issue bought up in the comments of the PR.
The suggestion is to use a CompatibleAdapter for this update as it is a backwards-compatible
extension of the operator. We agreed to merge this PR once this change is made.

### [PR 3607](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/3607): Extending `If`, `Loop`, and `Identity` ops to support `optional` type

We agreed that this PR is ready to be merged.

### [PR 3557](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/3557): Add `GridSample` Operator

As discussed previously, this operator is currently being tested in ONNX Runtime as a `contrib` operator.
The decision is to wait for this validation to be completed before mergint the PR.
