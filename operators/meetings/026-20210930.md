## Notes

### Infrastructure SIG updates

Next release of ONNX, version 1.11 is under active development. Release date tentatively planned for early November.
We are currently looking for representatives of an ONNX partner to act as release managers.
If you would like to see your pull requests/issues addressed in the next release, please add them to GitHub 
and tag with `milestone:1.11`. [Current list](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/milestones/1.11). 


### [PR 3741](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/3741): Signal processing operators

A new [pull request](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/3741) was created to add digital signal processing 
related operators to ONNX.

The list of included operators includes:

* DFT
* IDFT
* STFT
* ISTFT
* HannWindow
* HammingWindow
* BlackmanWindow
* MelSpectrogram

Work on previous pull request adding Fourier-related operators was stalled. This new PR includes these operators
and a few others requested by Adobe for processing audio data.

Author of PR Sheil Kumar joined the call and discussed the process of adding operators. A few comments listed in pull
request still need to be addressed including shape validation logic and tests. Other elements of the PR should
align with the [procedure for adding new operators](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/AddNewOp.md).


### [PR 3738](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/3738): Extend Where op to permit bfloat16 types

This pull request which extends `Where` operator to support additional data types, particularly bfloat, was merged.

### Gaps in opset converter

The topic of opset version converter for ONNX models came up during a recent ONNX roadmap presentation.

We currently have the majority of conversions covered, particularly when going up from a lower opset version 
to a higher opset version. We also have tests which will detect a missing adapter when new operator version
is being added to ONNX. All new operator changes must include a version converter from the previous version. 

There may be bugs in the conversion logic, which would not be caught by the automated tests. If you know of such 
problems, please let us know.

Our initial goal was to enable conversion of ONNX models from a lower opset version to a higher version.
Conversion in the opposite direction is also possible, but many adapters are missing. Please let us know
if you have use-cases which are blocked by this. At the moment we are adding down-level adapters 
on a best-effort basis.

### Opens

Jacky created a [pull request](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/3644) which adds a substantial change 
to the building of ONNX binaries on Windows. Previously the binary was compiled with the MSVC runtime 
statically. This resulted in some scenarios which caused crashes on Windows.

After this pull request is merged, ONNX will use the MSVC Runtime as a dynamic dependency. Most users
will already have the runtime installed on their systems, but those who don't will have to install it.

The PR is under testing. Please provide your input and let us know if you have any problems caused by this change.
Upcoming ONNX Weekly packages will include this change and will be provided for testing.
