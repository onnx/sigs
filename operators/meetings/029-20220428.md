## Notes

### Infrastructure SIG updates

Liqun Fu took over the SIG lead role from Ashwini Khade.

During last month's meeting of the ONNX Preprocessing workgroup, the idea was raised of adding a new 
family of preprocessing ops to a dedicated subdomain. The idea of splitting all operators into 
subdomain families (e.g. image processing, etc.) is now under consideration.

Another area of development is using sequences type values as initializers.

Some changes to the ONNX IR are in Pull Requests, but we're holding off merging those
until after the next ONNX release.

The next release ONNX 1.12 is scheduled for May/June timeframe. IBM will be the release managers.

ONNX 1.12 will be the first release which [will not publish](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/4111) 
`manylinux2014_i686` (32-bit instruction set) package due to low usage.

In order to make ONNX node tests more consistent, the test generation scripts will now use 
the `since_version` field which indicates when a given operator version was changed
to generate tests instead of changing tests to use the current ONNX version each time.

### [PR 4076](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/4076): new LayerNorm op proposal

This pull request define `LayerNorm` as an ONNX function. 
The idea is not controversial, forum recommended the PR to be merged.

### [PR 4113](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/4113): NonZero op update (treatment of scalar input)

This pull request adresses an issue with the `NonZero` op's shape inference. 

In the spec of `NonZero`, it states that it behaves similarly to `numpy.nonzero`.
However current shape inference for `NonZero` does not follow NumPy's behavior. 
Specifically, the shape of `NonZero(x)` should be `(1, N)` if `x` is a scalar.

This PR updates the shape inference logic to follow NumPy's behavior.
 
Rama suggests to reject this pull request and instead make a change in the specification's description
of `NonZero`, so that there is no special treatment (as in NumPy) for scalar input.

### [PR 3741](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/3741): new Signal ops (DFT and variants)

This is a large pull request that adds new signal ops to the ONNX domain. The idea to add these 
operators has wide support in the community, but no pull request reached the full maturity for merging.

In this current PR, we raise the following discussion topics:

* Shouldn't the window functions have a `periodic` attribute to match the PyTorch and Tensorflow implementations?
* It seems that the `ISTFT` is currently missing from the Pull Request.
* Should we add support for multiple axes?
* Do we need to specify the window size for DFT and STFT or at least STFT?

The documentation of the operations could also be extended, as it currenly mainly points to a single reference.

Perhaps it would be beneficial to split this PR into a series of smaller PRs with groups of related operators.

### [PR 3948](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/3948): new Col2Im operator proposal

This Pull Request introduces a `Col2Im` operator which rearranges input tensor in blocks. 
This behavior is similar to the `im2col` function in the 
[ATen library](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/api/function_namespaceat_1a979fbf85d8c7362d60d766bbf1639f10.html) 
used by PyTorch.

This is a low level operator, but it could be used to implement other high level operators as functions.

It may be useful to add a `Col2Im` and its counterpart `Im2Col` operators to ONNX. It would be 
great if those operators were added along with ONNX example functions which use them.


### [PR 3971](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/3971): Support for 16-bit Quantize/Dequantize

This PR makes the operator more generic.

The idea is not controversial, forum recommended the PR to be merged.

### [PR 4126](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/4126): Resize op update: add antialiasing attribute

This PR extends Resize with a new boolean parameter "antialiasing", which enables an antialiasing filter 
when downscaling with linear and cubic interpolation modes.

Forum recommended to approve the PR.
