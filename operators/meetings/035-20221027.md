## Notes

### Infrastructure SIG updates

Liqun Fu presented the Infrastructure SIG update.
Current work is mainly focused on closing topics related to the 1.13 release.


### Upcoming release

Przemek Wysocki presented the status of the upcoming ONNX release.
We are currently awaiting  code freeze, which is planned for 18th November. 
More timeline details can be found in PR [#4599](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/4599).

Please complete work related to release 1.13 before the code freeze.

### PR [#4089](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/4089): GridSample op 

This PR was aleady discussed in previous meetings. 
GitHub description and discussion is fairly detailed.
We would like to move forward with it and include it in the next release if possible.
Please review this pull request and leave your comments.


### PR [#4534](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/4534): LpPool op 

Remaining work for this PR includes adding a `dilations` attribute and tests. 
Przemek is working on this, he will go address these issues soon.


### PR [#4621](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/4621): GroupNormalization op

This pull request adds a new normalization operator `GroupNormalization` as an ONNX function. 

Group Norm is a commonly used normalization, similar to existing ONNX ops
such as BatchNormalization, InstanceNormalization, and LayerNormalization.

The operation is Supported in both Tensorflow and PyTorch. 
We discussed similarities and differences between the TensorFlow and PyTorch implementations 
and the proposed ONNX operation. 

Please review this PR and add your suggestions as to the best interface for this operator.

We can express InstanceNormalization as a special case of GroupNormalization, 
so we can consider defining InstanceNormalization as an ONNX function using GroupNormalization.
This could be a follow-up PR.
