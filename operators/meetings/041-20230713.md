## Notes

### Airbus collaboration: Machine Learning Model Description (MLMD) Requirements for ONNX Evaluation

Airbus is working on integrating AI systems for safety-critical systems, specifically for embedding in airplanes.
This project necessitates a certification process, adhering to the 
[ARP6983](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/arp6983/) standard. 

A vital component of this project is the Machine Learning Model Description (MLMD) which 
defines the interface between software and hardware. Airbus has identified ONNX as a potential platform
to support the MLMD, citing its ability to provide explicit and comprehensive semantics for all operations in the model.

The MLMD's objective is to support the exact replication of a model from its design phase
to the final implementation. This functionality is particularly important 
for Machine Learning Constituents (MLC) - subsystems containing the models.


### Criteria for ONNX

The key selection criteria for ONNX, as outlined by Marie-Charlotte Teulieres of Airbus, includes interoperability, 
and the explicit description of semantics involving computational graphs and all operators. 
Airbus pointed out the necessity to complete the description of all mathematical formulas for all operations. 

Airbus offered positive feedback regarding ONNX, albeit with three suggestions for enhancement.

1. **Explicit Unambiguous Description of Operator Semantics:** 
Airbus suggests incorporating mathematical formulas to provide explicit, unambiguous descriptions
of operator semantics. As a starting point, creating a subset of operators fulfilling all constraints,
such as considering overflow for data types, was suggested. Alexandre and Michal proposed it would be valuable 
for the formulas to be specified in a language that is not only human-readable but also machine-readable.
This would allow the formulas to be used for testing and verification purposes.
While Python implementations are useful, they were deemed insufficient.

2. **Human-Readable Format:** 
Airbus pointed out that a human-readable text representation of the models is a requirement. 
The textual representation of protocol buffers, currently available, was deemed clumsy and difficult to read.
Rama brought up the ONNX markup format as a more reader-friendly and viable alternative, 
although further work is necessary to make it more complete and usable. 
A potential future need to transition away from Protobuf was also suggested.

3. **Control Flow and Execution Order:** Airbus emphasized the need to specify the execution order for all operations. 
This is something which ONNX currently does not specify. 
An optimizer could enable a check for consistency between two orders to ensure they produce the same result.

### Going Forward

Improvements to the documentation are welcomed in the form of Pull Requests, which Airbus is encouraged 
to create and contribute to, especially concerning the three suggestions outlined.
