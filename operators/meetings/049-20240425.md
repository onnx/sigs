### Infrastructure SIG updates

Charles Volzka mentioned a need for a patch release aimed at resolving installation issues 
on systems not based on the x86 architecture. Issues arise when attempting installations on these systems 
using versions of GCC that were outdated. The current version of ONNX (1.16.0) cannot be installed
on such machines. To address this, he suggested a minor version update to 1.16.1, which would 
incorporate a fix.

### Airbus Presentation on Embedded AI and Certification

During the meeting, Christophe Gabreau from Airbus provided an overview of their efforts
to integrate AI into safety-critical systems. This creates a need for a robust framework to ensure
AI models are both deployable and verifiable within stringent environments. 
He emphasized the collaboration with industry partners and academic institutions 
and referenced the ongoing work to create a standard, which is outlined in SAE International's document
[ARP6983](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/arp6983/).

The current effort is focused on developing a specification profile which can be embedded 
in an ONNX model and provide additional information required for certification. In particular,
the profile would include information on the explicit unambiguous semantics of operators, 
operation order and control flow in the model and express this information in a human-readable form.

The proposed specification of operator semantics is built around the [Why3 language](https://www.why3.org/), 
which allows for the formal verification of the model. The Why3 specification can be used to 
verify an implementation of an operator using [Frama-C](https://frama-c.com/)

Reproducing floating-point operations in bit-exact fashion may not be platform independent.
A range of reference values for floating-point operations may have to be provided to ensure
consistent results. Further consistency issues are caused by execution parallelism. 
Airbus is currently researching this area.

A proposal was made to create a dedicated ONNX working group to work regularly on 
the challenges of embedded AI and certification. It would be good to present this proposal
at the next ONNX community meeting in June.

### ONNX community meetup

Ramakrishnan Sivakumar brought up the next 
[ONNX community event](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/events/details/lfhq-lf-ai-data-foundation-presents-mark-your-calendars-for-the-onnx-community-meetup-2024-june-28th-2024-at-amd-san-jose/)
which will be held on June 28th, 2024 at AMD San Jose.

A [call for papers](https://share.hsforms.com/1HcnE9jr1TLGA1-w5IrMrMg4tvhy) is currently open. 
Please submit your proposals.


### [PR 5970](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/5970): Excluding test data from ONNX package

The PR proposes to exclude test data from the ONNX package to reduce its size from 51 MB to 12 MB. 
This move would be beneficial as it would make the package lighter and more efficient for the vast 
majority of users who do not require the test data for their applications. 
However, concerns were raised about the impact on users who rely on this data for various reasons,
such as running continuous integration systems or validating model conversions and optimizations.

The group considered alternatives to address these concerns, such as making the test data available
as a separate package. This solution would maintain access for users who need the test data 
while keeping the primary ONNX package streamlined. The conversation highlighted 
the need for careful planning to ensure that the test data package is updated in tandem with 
the main ONNX releases to avoid compatibility issues.

### [PR 6099](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/6099): Add bfloat16 support to relevant ops

This PR adds bfloat16 as an allowed data type for a number of operations where it was previously not supported.
The change is minor but impacts a significant number of operations, and will allow ONNX
to handle data types more uniformly.
