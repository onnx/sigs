from the meeting.


### Infrastructure SIG updates

The ONNX 1.18 release was discussed. The Release Candidate RC1 was already published, RC2 is under preparation.
New features will include static code analysis improvements, support for Python 3.13 support, including free-threading 
variant and support for Windows ARM64. Concern was raised about limited communication of ONNX releases during the 
RC phase and limited community testing.
